## Introduction

Watermarking is a common technique used to protect digital content by embedding a visible or invisible marker into the image. However, there are scenarios where it becomes necessary to extract watermarks from images, such as in digital forensics or content manipulation detection.

This project explores various methods for watermark extraction, starting from traditional techniques and transitioning to deep learning-based approaches for improved accuracy and robustness.

## Project Structure

- **`attempts/`**: Contains initial methods attempted for watermark embedding and extraction.
- **`watermarks.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook providing an overview of the project, including code implementations and explanations.

## Initial Attempts

The `attempts` folder contains the initial methods and strategies explored for watermark embedding and extraction. These methods were experimented with before transitioning to deep learning techniques.

## Transition to Deep Learning

Recognizing the limitations of traditional watermark extraction methods, the project transitioned to deep learning techniques. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were employed to develop models capable of accurately detecting and removing watermarks from images.

## Strategy and Code Explanation

The project strategy involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Images containing watermarks are collected and preprocessed.
2. **Traditional Methods**: Initial attempts involve experimenting with traditional watermark embedding and extraction techniques, such as frequency domain analysis and template matching.
3. **Deep Learning Approach**: Due to the limitations of traditional methods, the project transitions to deep learning techniques. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilized to develop models capable of accurately detecting and removing watermarks.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The developed CNN models are trained on the prepared dataset and evaluated for accuracy and performance.
5. **Iterative Improvement**: The models are iteratively refined and improved based on evaluation results and feedback.

## Repository Structure

- **`watermarks.ipynb`**: This notebook provides detailed explanations of the project, including the rationale behind the transition to deep learning, code implementations, and insights into the experimentation process.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run the `watermarks.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to experiment with watermark extraction techniques.

## Future Directions

The project is ongoing, and there are several potential future directions:

- Refinement of deep learning models for improved performance.
- Exploration of additional techniques for watermark extraction, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or reinforcement learning.
- Integration of the developed models into practical applications or tools for digital content protection and manipulation detection.
